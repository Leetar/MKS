Modular Kolonization System (MKS) 
===

This is the repository for the MKS and OKS mods for [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com)

MKS and OKS are the original works of RoverDude (GitHub user BobPalmer).  

You can find the official repo for this mod on [Github](https://github.com/UmbraSpaceIndustries/MKS).  Releases, along with other USI products, can be found on [the USI Catalog Page](https://umbraspaceindustries.github.io/UmbraSpaceIndustries/). 

### Supported Mods
(MKS includes additional functionality when these mods are present)
* [USI Life Support](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/105202-13-usi-life-support-050/)
* [TAC Life Support](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/146465-141-tac-life-support-v0139-release-17th-march-2018/)

* [Extraplanetary Launchpads](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545)

NOTE:  For Life Support Mods (USI, TAC, or Snacks!) it is recommended you only pick one!  USI-LS is the default, and will afford the most support and integration, but TAC-LS and Snacks! are also fully supported.
